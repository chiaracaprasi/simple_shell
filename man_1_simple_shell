.SH DESCRIPTION


The C_SHELL is the reproduction of the standard command interpreter for the system. This man page is not intended to be a complete explanation or tutorial of the shell.

.SH OVERVIEW

The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
 interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is a program that will need to be executed before use. The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features including some to aid interactive use. Commands can be typed directlly into the the running shell, or can be put into a file which can be executed directly by the shell.

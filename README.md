#  üåäüêö C SHELL 
#### By Chiara, Declan and Matthew

## ü§ø What is the C Shell? 

C Shell is a reproduction of the original UNIX shell in C. Same as the orginal shell, it's a program that takes commands by the user via the keyboard and gives them to the OS (operating system) to perform. 

This project is part of Holberton School Australia curriculum.
